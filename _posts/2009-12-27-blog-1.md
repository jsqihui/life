title: Oh Girl~ 写在纽约7号线
---

现在的流行歌都是中文夹杂了散装英语，等我好好学几门语言后和基础乐理后，我写中文歌+英文rap+日语旁白+希伯来文引圣经做结尾…哈哈，那会就牛了。

今天坐7号线回来，没啥事干，外面下着雨，又想起了同样的雨天，所以就拿出iphone假模假样的写了一首诗，算是纪念一下一段时间吧。等我弹熟悉了canon in c 后一定开始重头学乐理，然后自己写歌自己填词。

 

Oh Girl~

I fell in love when I looked into your eyes,
They called it a crash between boys and girls.

We spent three interesting days together,
From one end of the city to the other.
We ate ice creams at the sunset,
The most beautiful scene I have seen ever.

Life was hard after I was back,
’cause missing u like a storm tortured my heart.
After about one month it calmed down,
left rainbow illusion for me to pursue.

How dare I say the word,
’cause it is so serious and means to me the world.

Oh girl~

So I wrote down the goodness of you to encourage myself,
But  after filled the paper, I tossed it away
A feeling could never say in this way.

I wanted to know you more,
but had never learned how.

After months, finally I got ready to say love,
But sadly, just found you leave.

A story should have been fantasy is over,
And several days, months or years later,
I will get healed and understand,

Oh, girl~

Nothing in the world is forever!
