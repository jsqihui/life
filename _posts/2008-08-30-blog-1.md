title: The first weekend in the semester
---

I write this blog with the Ubuntu, one version of Unix. I am not able to use Chinese on this OS. The studying is tough here and lots of new things need to learn and practice. I will spare no effort to handle it. There is no windows system in our lab. They are all Macs and Linux. It is not easy. The database needs so much reading while the AI fond. needs a good programming skill. There is still another course, data compress. However I have 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. So that’s quite fair and I have no weakness.
